Data
This data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. There are three possible answers people can choose from:

“Right away”
“Later, before the coupon expires”
“No, I do not want the coupon”
The first two responses are labeled as “Y = 1,” and the third is labeled as “Y = 0.” There are five different types of coupons: Less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carryout and takeaway, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).

Deliverables
Your final submission should include the Practical Application 1 Jupyter Notebook and other relevant files, such as the dataset provided and uploaded to a public-facing GitHub repository as your first portfolio project. To explore the data, you will utilize your knowledge of pandas and Python to create statistical summaries demonstrating differences in those who accepted and rejected the coupon. Utilize the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create a visualization using Python. Ensure that your findings are clearly stated in a separate section alongside actionable items and recommendations.

Your repository should also include a READMe file containing a brief nontechnical report that highlights the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons.
